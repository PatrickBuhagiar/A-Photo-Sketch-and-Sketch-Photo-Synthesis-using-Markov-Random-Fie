# A-Photo-Sketch-and-Sketch-Photo-Synthesis-using-Markov-Random-Fields
This project is my undergraduate dissertation for when I was reading BSc Computing Science at the University of Malta. The final mark achieved was 70. 

The main aim of this dissertation was to compare and contrast two approaches for preparing sketches for face-recognition. One typical scenario is when artists sketch a suspect from witness recollection. Since this is typically a pencil sketch, traditional face recognition programs, which are usually trained against real photos, do not work well. 

The two approaches are:
1) Generating a realistic photo from a sketch, and applying face recognition on the synthesised photo
2) Convert photos from a database (e.g. passport database) to sketches, and train face recognition on these sketches

For both approaches, A patch based technique using Markov Random Fields was implemented to prepare the sketches or photos for face recognition.
